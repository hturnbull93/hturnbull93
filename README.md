I am a Full Stack developer, looking for new opportunities to continue to learn, challenge myself, and work with great people to build amazing things.

I trained at [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/) (London's leading programming bootcamp), to learn best practices, tools and methodologies, which led me to my Full Stack position at AppScore Technology Ltd.

## Skills

### Agile Project Organisation

At AppScore I championed the use of agile methodologies. Previously the team had little structure in place in terms of creating tickets and planning developments. I introduced more stringent requirements for tickets to be considered ready for development and completed. This has led to an improvement in our ability to estimate work and affect positive development workflow changes in response to retrospective sessions.

### Team-Focused 

The team is only as strong as its members. I mentor a junior developer through group planning sessions, pairing on tickets, and code review. As part of the agile methodology described above, we mob on problems to unblock team members as quickly as possible.

### Communication

When communicating with non-technical stakeholders, I translate technical details to and from less technical terms easily. Additionally, I have successfully used my ability to communicate, and my experience of good UX/UI design, to persuade clients away from features that would annoy users.

### Reflection

I believe the best way to know if you truly understand something is to communicate it clearly to someone else. With that in mind I maintain a [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@hturnbull93) of things I learn and want to share my understanding of.

### Technical Knowledge

I have worked with a variety of languages, technologies and softwares.
